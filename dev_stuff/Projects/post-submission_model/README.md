Main Flow of the Post-submission Business Logic Project
Here's a breakdown of the main flow for your project:

1. Form Management:

Users create forms with questions and configure action components.
Forms are stored in the database with associated questions and metadata.
2. Response Submission:

Users submit responses to forms, providing answers to questions.
Responses are stored in the database with associated form and submitter details.
3. Post-submission Action Triggering:

Django signals are triggered upon response creation.
Signal receivers are notified and initiate action execution.
4. Action Execution:

Action components are invoked based on the configured actions for the form.
Each action component performs its specific task asynchronously using Celery and RabbitMQ.
5. Action-specific Processing:

Google Sheets export action component formats and exports response data to a Google Sheet.
SMS notification action component generates and sends SMS notifications to users.
Other action components perform their designated tasks based on their logic.
6. Monitoring and Error Handling:

System health metrics like queue backlog and worker performance are monitored.
Alerts are triggered for critical events and errors.
Retries and error handling mechanisms ensure data consistency and action completion.
7. User Interface:

Users manage forms, configure actions, and view response data.
Dashboards visualize system health and action execution logs.
Additional Flows:

System administrators manage action components and configure settings.
Access control mechanisms ensure data security and user permissions.
Scheduled tasks can be implemented for periodic actions or data processing.

This is a high-level overview of the main flow. Specific implementations may vary based on your chosen technologies and additional functionalities. Remember to adapt and customize this flow to meet your specific needs and project requirements.
